Written Report:
    The timer starts when I call ct.Reset() in main(). If the user chooses linear search, 
    we loop through every requested book to put through the linear search, which alone is 
    O(M). The linear search has an approximate time complexity of O(N) since we loop through 
    N total new books. In total, since we run the linear search M times, the time complexity
    should theoretically be O(N*M). 

    If the user chooses binary search, the average runtime should be noticibly shorter than
    linear search in most scenarios. During all scenarios, we loop through every requested book,
    which is O(M). The binary search is known to be O(log(N)), and since we run the binary search
    for every requested book, the total time complexity should theoretically be O(M*log(N)).

    Overall, for moderate to large new books N (50-1000) and small amounts of requested books M, 
    binary search is consistently faster on average than linear search, often by factors of 2-10.
    For small N, linear search can still be as fast if not faster for small and medium request sizes. As
    N and M grow, the theoretical advantage of binary search appears in the data that as linear time
    grows roughly proportionally, while binary grows more slowly. Since linear is O(N*M) and binary is
    O(M*log(N)), binary will theoretically win in CPU time.

Source of Error: 
    Unfortunately, I realized too late that I had run all the trials and collected 
    the data incorrectly. In main(), I initially would run the std::sort function
    on the new books BEFORE the I even start the timer. This drastically changes the expected outcome
    since I already have a sorted set of books to work with, which lowers CPU time for the binary search.
    Knowing this, I can just assume that the binary search should be running a little longer than the
    data currently represents. Since std::sort has an average time complexity of O(N*log(N)), we would 
    add that to the binary search time complexity. Therefore, if I had written the code properly the first
    time, the binary search would have been O(M*log(N) + N*log(N)). In this case, for N = M, binary search
    should theoretically be faster than linear in all cases. For N > M and N < M, binary search will still be 
    faster than linear search in all cases. I proved this with desmos graphs by plugging in the same values as
    the experimental data.

    I rewrote my code to run the sort ONLY if the user selects binary search or recursive binary search.
    Now, binary search should theoretically be O(M*log(N) + N*log(N)) while linear search remains O(M*N).
